<h2>Why I Created This & What's New?</h2>

This theme was just on bootstrap, I noticed that a lot of people need some changes to the original version so I thought of making this on 
WordPress so it is easy for everyone to add new functionality to this.

My Version includes:

<ul>
<li>A Blog</li>
<li>Drag and Drop DIVI Builder</li>
<li>Custom Post Type of Portfolio</li>
<li>Easily Editable for more Desired Functionality</li>
</ul>

I created this theme in around 3 days. All the real credits go to the original author/creator of this template who did this using Bootstrap.

I am available for Custom Development, Bugs fixing (if found any ) and anything related to this theme. Contact me personally on <a href="https://twitter.com/affuxo">Twitter</a>.
